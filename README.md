Work Manager is a project used for my capstone. It contains a JavaFX application that
will take in data from the Microsoft Azure cloud server and display it in tables. 
The application will take in the jobs, and assign variables to it to be used in the 
Multiple Linear Regression model. The model will be used to create time estimates for
future incomplete jobs.
The interface will include a login screen, a main window that displays information,
a window to create, and modify jobs. 
The main window will contain the ability to create,modify, and delete buttons. There
will be a get details button that will display the results of the MLR model and the
time estimates for incomplete jobs.
